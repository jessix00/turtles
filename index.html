                    <h1>Turtles Are Reptiles</h1>
                    <p>Characterised by a special bony or cartilaginous shell developed from their ribs and acting as a shield. "Turtle" may refer to the order as a whole or to fresh-water and sea-dwelling testudines.The order Testudines includes both extant
                        and extinct species. The earliest known members of this group date from 157 million years ago, making turtles one of the oldest reptile groups and a more ancient group than snakes or crocodilians. Of the 327 known species alive
                        today, some are highly endangered.Turtles are ectotherms—their internal temperature varies according to the ambient environment, commonly called cold-blooded. However, because of their high metabolic rate, leatherback sea turtles
                        have a body temperature that is noticeably higher than that of the surrounding water.Turtles are classified as amniotes, along with other reptiles, birds, and mammals. Like other amniotes, turtles breathe air and do not lay eggs
                        underwater, although many species live in or around water.</p>

                    <h2>Shell</h2>
                    <p>The upper shell of the turtle is called the carapace. The lower shell that encases the belly is called the plastron. The carapace and plastron are joined together on the turtle's sides by bony structures called bridges. The inner layer
                        of a turtle's shell is made up of about 60 bones that include portions of the backbone and the ribs, meaning the turtle cannot crawl out of its shell. In most turtles, the outer layer of the shell is covered by horny scales called
                        scutes that are part of its outer skin, or epidermis. Scutes are made up of the fibrous protein keratin that also makes up the scales of other reptiles. These scutes overlap the seams between the shell bones and add strength to
                        the shell. Some turtles do not have horny scutes; for example, the leatherback sea turtle and the soft-shelled turtles have shells covered with leathery skin, instead.</p>

                    <h2>Limbs</h2>
                    <p>Sea turtles are almost entirely aquatic and have flippers instead of feet. Sea turtles fly through the water, using the up-and-down motion of the front flippers to generate thrust; the back feet are not used for propulsion, but may
                        be used as rudders for steering. Compared with freshwater turtles, sea turtles have very limited mobility on land, and apart from the dash from the nest to the sea as hatchlings, male sea turtles normally never leave the sea. Females
                        must come back onto land to lay eggs. They move very slowly and laboriously, dragging themselves forwards with their flippers</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Turtles have a hard shell that protects them like a shield, this upper shell is called a ‘carapace’.</li>
                    <li>The largest turtle is the leatherback sea turtle, it can weigh over 900 kg! (2000 lb) Turtles lay eggs.</li>
                    <li>Turtles have existed for around 215 million years.</li>
                    <li>Like other reptiles, turtles are cold blooded.</li>
                    <li>Sea turtles have special glands which help remove salt from the water they drink.</li>
                    <li>In some species of turtle the temperature determines if the egg will develop into a male or female, lower temperatures lead to a male while higher temperatures lead to a female.</li>
